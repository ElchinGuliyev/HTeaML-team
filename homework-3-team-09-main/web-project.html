                <h2>Lab Project</h2>
                <h2>NOT-Gate</h2>
                <p>
                    We started to construct NOT- gate. We placed a transistor, LED lamp, bottom, two resistors (330 Ohm, 2K Ohm) and cables to the breadboard. When we do not press the button, the current flows through R2 (330 Ohm) resistor, passes the LED lamp and reaches the negative pole. So, when our input is False, the output will be True, and the LED lamp will work. On the other hand, if press the button, then R1 (2K Ohm) resistor will activate the transistor and the current reach the minus pole with the passing the emitter of the transistor. So, when our input is True, the output will be False, and the LED lamp will not work.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article class="and">
                <h2>AND-Gate</h2>
                <p>
                    Secondly, we constructed AND-gate. We placed three transistors, 4 resistors (3 2K Ohm, 1 330 Ohm), two bottoms, a LED lamp and cables. When we press none of the buttons, the LED lamp will not work. If we press one of the buttons, the LED lamp will not work again. However, if we press both buttons, the 2K resistors will activate the transistors which are connected sequentially. The current flows the emitters of these transistors. Moreover, because of the third transistor is not active, the current flows through the 330 Ohm resistor and passes the LED lamp. So, LED lamp will work. To sum up, if our inputs are TRUE and FALSE or FALSE and FALSE, the output of the AND-gate will be FALSE, and the LED lamp will not work. If both inputs are TRUE, the output also will be TRUE, and the LED lamp will light.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article class="or">
                <h2>OR-Gate</h2>
                <p>
                    We finalized with OR-gate. We used three transistors, four resistors (3 2K Ohm, 1 330 Ohm), two bottoms, a LED lamp, and cables. In the first case, since no button is pressed, the current turns on the transistor Q1 through the 2 KOM(R4) resistor, and our 330 OM (R2) resistor transfers all the current to the collector, which is transferred to the negative pole through the electric emitter. This means that in this case the LED (D1) lamp is not working, being out of the circuit. In other possible cases, when one or both buttons are pressed, the 2 KOM (R4) resistor current is not transferred to the Q1 transistor, but to the collector of the Q2 or Q3 (or both) transistors and goes from the emitter to the negative pole. This means that our transistor Q1 stays out of the circuit in these 3 cases, and our 330 OM resistor (R2) passes current to the LED, turning on the lamp. So, when our inputs will be TRUE and TRUE or TRUE and FALSE, the output of OR gate will be TRUE. On the other hand, if the inputs will be FALSE and FALSE, the output will be also FALSE.

                <h2>Web-Site Project</h2>
                <p>This project was very interesting. Each of us did our bests completing this task. Firstly, we divided site into four parts and planned the whole site. We registrated in Github then connected it to VScode and started writing code. Subhan Jafarli had created HOME page of web-site. He included tabs here and links to them. Nazrin Jalilova completed EVENTS part of website. She described the hour of code event which we participated in. Ulvi Ramazanli constructed the part about web-project and gave details about lab and web site projects. Elchin Guliyev did his best by giving all details about team members in ABOUT TEAM tab of site. Moreover, all of us used CSS in our pages in order to make our site look more attention grabbing. </p>
            </article>
            <p>Then we completed bonus tasks and finalized our project.</p>
